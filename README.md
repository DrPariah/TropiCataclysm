# TropiCataclysm
a mod for the game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (and possibly Cataclysm: Bright Nights in the future). At the moment the mod is currently a fork of the "Desert Region" mod but the plan is to grow it into a proper content mod.

#What is TropiCataclysm?:
In essence, TropiCataclysm is a conversion of the regular Cataclsym: Dark Days Ahead. It changes the setting of the game from New England to an undefined region in the tropics (loosely based on Central/South America but also carrying some stuff from Africa and maybe Asia/Oceania).
